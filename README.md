Unofficial Sudbury Bus Tracker
==============================

The first iteration of the bus tracker sucked. So... I made a bet that I can
write a new one that's bigger, better, and stronger in <6 hours. So I did.

To run:

 1. Clone
 2. Virtualenv
 3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 4. `python server.py`

Client side is AngularJS and Bootstrap 3. A good idea now would be retheming
bootstrap 3 and get rid of all the useless parts in bootstrap3 to save space.

Also, appcache could be interesting.
